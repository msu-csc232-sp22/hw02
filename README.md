## Submission Details

As usual, prior to submitting your assignment to Blackboard, be sure that you have commited and pushed your final changes to GitHub. Once your final changes have been pushed, create a pull request that seeks to merge the changes in your `develop` branch into your `trunk` branch. Once your pull request has been created, submit the URL of your assignment _repository_ (i.e., _not_ the URL of the pull request) as a Link Resource in Blackboard. Please note: the timestamp of the submission on Blackboard is used to assess any late penalties if and when warrented, _not_ the date/time you create your pull request. **No more exceptions will be granted for this oversight**.

### Due Date

Your Blackboard submission is due by 11:59 PM, ...

### Grading Rubric

This assignment is worth **5 points**.

All homework assignments are graded on the following general rubric:

* (Up to) 1 point is earned for creating the pull request and submitting your repositories URL into the Blackboard assignment by the due date.
* (Up to) 1 point is earned for proper coding style
* (Up to) 3 points are earned for program correctness; the points are determined by the degree to which your solution passes the unit tests.

### Late Penalty

In the first 24 hour period following the due date, this lab will be penalized 1 point meaning the grading starts at 4 (out of 5 total possible) points.

In the second 24 hour period following the due date, this lab will be penalized 2 points meaning the grading starts at 3 (out of 5 total possible) points.

After 48 hours, the assignment will not be graded and thus will not earn any points, i.e., your grade will be 0 out of 5 possible points.
